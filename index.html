	<h1>About Us</h1>
        Myxt Bots started with two friends. With the blistering summer heat beating down on them, they decided to head inside and work on a Discord Bot for a simple yet fun purpose - counting in chat. The purpose of this bot is for two or more players to count up from one and achieve a high score by getting the highest consecutive number before someone says the wrong number. After that venture, the dynamic duo began work on this site for everyone to be able to access their product. The Myxt partners then began testing the bot with others, and found outstanding success! Note that this site is a phishing scam for educational purposes. Eventually, after working on other things, such as applications, web games, and other educational projects, the group decided to return to their origins, and dusted off the bot. Slowly adding more and more functionality, we got what we have today, Myxt Bots, and their flagship masterpiece, the Counting Bot.
